# Code of Conduct

We are working on an appropriate Code of Conduct to add to this project. Please check back here soon. In the meantime, please be considerate and respectful, and read the Diversity Statement below.

# Diversity

Good Eggs and the angular-cached-resource project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.

We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse developer community is stronger and more vibrant. A diverse community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas.

Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make it all-inclusive, we recognize that there are specific attributes that are used to discriminate against people. In alphabetical order, some of these attributes include (but are not limited to): age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental difference, politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. We welcome people regardless of the values of these or other attributes.

# Attribution

This code of conduct and diversity statement is heavily based on the [Homebrew Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/CODEOFCONDUCT.md), which in turn is based on the [Python Community Code of Conduct](http://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/) and [Diversity Statement](http://www.python.org/community/diversity/).
